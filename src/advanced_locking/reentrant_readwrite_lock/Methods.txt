// Lock rwlock = new ReenterantReadWriteLock();

1) Multiple threads can acquire readLock simulataneously (Reads don't block each other)
2) Only a single thread is allowed to lock a writeLock
3) Mutual exclusion between readers and writers
    - If a writeLock is acquired, no thread can acquire a readLock
    - If at least one thread is holding a readLock, no thread can acquire a writeLock
