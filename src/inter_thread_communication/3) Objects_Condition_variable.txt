*** Objects as condtion variable :

=> wait(), notify() and notifyAll()
The object class contains following methods:
    1) public final void wait() throws InterruptedException
    2) public final void notify()
    3) public final void notifyAll()

We can use any object as a condition variable and lock(using synchronized keyword)

    1) wait() - Causes the current thread to wait until another thread wakes it up.
                In wait state, no CPU is consumed.
    Two ways to wake up waiting thread:
    2) notify() - Wakes up a single waiting thread on the object(if many only one woken up arbitrarily)
    3) notifyAll() - Wakes up all waiting threads

=> To call above 3 methods, we need to acquire monitor of that object(use synchronized on the object)

Ex: 

    public class MySharedClass{
        public boolean isComplete = false;

        public void waitUntilComplete(){
            synchronized(this){
                while(isComplete == false){
                    this.wait();
                }
            }
        }

        public void complete(){
            syncronized(this){
                isComplete = true;
                this.notify();
            }
        }

    }


This is similar to condition variables but we used 
current object as condition variable as well as the lock.

Object Signalling             Condition variable
------------------------|---------------------------
synchronized(object){           lock.lock()
}                               lock.unlock()
object.wait()                   condition.await()
object.notify                   condition.signal()
object.notifyAll                condition.signalAll()

------------------------------------------------------

Best implementation as current object is the lock: 

public class MySharedClass{
        public boolean isComplete = false;

        public void synchronized waitUntilComplete(){
            while(isComplete == false){
                wait();
            }
        }

        public void synchronized complete(){
            isComplete = true;
            notify();
        }
    }
