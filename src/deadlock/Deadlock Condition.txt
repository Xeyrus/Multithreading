1) Mutual Exclusion : Only one thread can have exclusive access to a resource.
2) Hold and Wait : At least one thread is holding a resource and is waiting for another resource.
3) Non-preemptive allocation : A resource is released only after the thread is done using it.
4) Circular wait : A chain of at least 2 threads each one is holding one resource and waiting for another resource.


To resolve deadlock:
At least one of the condition is not met.
Easiest way is to avoid circular wait.
Simply acquire locks on their shared resources in same order.
